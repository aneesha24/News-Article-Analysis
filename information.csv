5/29/2003,Apple Finds a Route For Online Music Sales,"Apple Computer seems to have the future of online music in its hands for the moment. Its new service, iTunes Music Store, has been the first real success story in the long effort to sell music over the Internet. In just its first month of operation the service, by the company's estimate, has sold three million songs online, at 99 cents each. This is an impressive figure considering the limited access that music fans now have to the service. Less than 1 percent of the country's home computers are Macintoshes that are compatible with the iTunes Music Store, and only a fraction of those have a broadband connection to the Internet.    But it would not be an online success story without a complicating twist. That complication came this week when the specter of the music industry, which has been publicly supportive of iTunes, began to loom over Apple. The success of iTunes, after all, depends on cooperation from the music business, which controls the songs that iTunes wants in its collection. Apparently trying to stay in the record industry's good graces, iTunes removed a service it had previously offered customers. Called Rendezvous, the service enabled listeners and their friends to access one another's music and listen to it -- but not download it -- from any computers. Hackers, however, had figured out how to download the music as well, creating programs with names like iLeach and iSlurp. So on Tuesday Apple sent out an update for its iTunes software, disabling Rendezvous and limiting music access to a user's local network at home or at work.  "

Whether it's a paid endorsement or not is beside the point. The iPod looks like it belongs in the video. As Microsoft has been cast in the role of Goliath in the personal computing wars, Macintosh has been playing David. And right now the stone in its slingshot is music. Not only is the iPod the top digital music player in the field, but earlier this year Apple's iTunes Music Store became the first legitimate music downloading service viewed as a success in the business, with one million songs downloaded (at 99 cents each) in its first week. The figure is impressive considering that less than 1 percent of the country's home computers are Macintoshs that are compatible with the iTunes Music Store.  "

12/2/2003,Bobbing Aloof From the Apple,"New York's landlubbers find it more ludicrous than insulting that Tom DeLay, the majority leader of the House of Representatives, may offer to house hundreds of solons, fat-cat donors and lobbyists in a luxury cruise ship off the Manhattan shore during next summer's Republican National Convention. If he prevails over growing G.O.P. embarrassment at such a floating symbol of gated plutocracy, we urge Mr. DeLay to forgo any ''Master and Commander'' regalia he may have in mind. Instead, the flinty Texan should borrow Nathan Detroit's double-breasted pinstripes to come ashore from the newest established permanent floating avoidance game in New York.    At the rate he is going, Mr. DeLay will steal the show from President Bush -- in ways the Republicans may regret. His plan to have a children's charity help underwrite the expenses for convention galas and provide a tax-free spot for major donors to deposit their cash is controversial enough. But having some of the G.O.P.'s best and richest walk a gangplank to and from the city each day has just the hint of xenophobia that already finds Democrats dancing in the streets. The Republicans made much of their decision to hold the convention in Democrat-heavy New York, in no small part as a gesture toward the city's perseverance after 9/11. Mayor Michael Bloomberg welcomed the custom for the city's hotels, restaurants and nightspots. But Mr. DeLay's former chief of staff has been lobbying for the mass embarkation to the Norwegian Dawn, a 15-deck, 14-bar, 10-restaurant ship offering ultrapriced rooms and what Mr. DeLay's office deems ''good security'' for up to 2,200 passengers.

4/3/2005,The Lost Apple," In 2002 and 2003, Fiona Apple recorded what would have been her third album, ''Extraordinary Machine.'' Its producer, Jon Brion, has said that Ms. Apple's label, Sony Music's Epic Records, shelved the album because it didn't hear potential hit singles. An Epic spokeswoman said, ''Fiona has not yet delivered her next album.'' Lately, what purports to be the full album, 11 songs, has been leaked onto the Internet, where -- despite the efforts of Sony's legal department -- a simple search will find multiple sources of downloads. The album is an oddball gem.    Its producer, Mr. Brion, is fond of instruments that huff and plink and wheeze, as he showed in his soundtrack for ''I [heart] Huckabees.'' Epic may have been discomfited that Ms. Apple's collaboration with him doesn't sound anything like what's on the radio now. As a songwriter, she's the same Fiona Apple who sold millions of copies of her first two albums; she's still sultry and sullen, obsessing in detail over why her romances went wrong and teetering between regret and revenge. Her vocals smolder like torch songs, then boil over with rage and accusations. But this time, the music doesn't always mope with her.    The album sets the 21st century aside. The beats are often waltzes and oom-pahs, not hip-hop or punk; the arrangements are full of cellos, horns, bells and vintage keyboards. Ms. Apple's piano and voice are still at the center of the music, but now orchestras and show bands sprout around her, adding layers of whimsy and artifice. Ms. Apple has always placed herself somewhere between confession and entertainment, but in songs like ''Window'' or ''Better Version of Me,'' the carnival bounces and mock-Hollywood glitz put a cartoonish frame around her traumas, giving them a brand-new perspective.    Had it been released, ''Extraordinary Machine'' would have been a fine counterbalance to a pop moment full of monolithic, self-righteous sincerity. As it stands, mysteriously leaked and proliferating, the album is an object lesson in how an Internet that's not controlled by copyright holders can set artistic expression free.   JON PARELES  "

Although America Online once required that you use its own software to send and receive mail from your AOL account, you can now use a standard e-mail program like Outlook or Eudora to manage your AOL mail.

Is there any reason to wait?    A. Apple Computer's recent announcement that it was changing the processors inside its Macintosh computers means some big changes when the company switches to Intel-based chips from the current PowerPC processors made by I.B.M. and Motorola. Apple plans to release some Macs with Intel processors starting in 2006, and hopes to have most new Macs running the chips by 2007.     Such a change typically means that programs and software written to run on one type of processor must be rewritten or modified to work on a different processor. Some companies may create a version of a program that runs on both PowerPC and Intel chips, while others may sell the versions separately.  "

10/23/2005,"Across the Bay, an Outpost of Cool","It was tremendously busy at the Staten Island Mall last weekend, but not for the usual reasons. No one flipped through the 2006 Orlando Bloom calendars at Day by Day Calendar Company, nor was there interest in the colorful bulk sweets at Candylicious. No lines materialized for the hydro-massage ''Spa Capsule'' chamber, even at the reasonable rate of $10 for seven minutes.     Instead, mallgoers cheerfully elbowed their way into a new store with big glass windows and only a shining white silhouette of an apple to serve as its name. For its second retail location in New York after its two-story bazaar in SoHo, Apple Computer had chosen Staten Island. And although the island might seem an unlikely choice for a new Apple store ahead of supposedly hipper city districts, the decision seemed a smart one, at least judging by the crowds on its opening day, Oct. 15.

The wife is blond and beautiful, the father strapping; the children are dear.      Because ''Criminal Minds'' is a bloody procedural where no one is ever killed simply over back loans or bad cocaine, the circumstances of the family's imminent murder are predictably bizarre: an intruder breaks in to assume the role of paterfamilias, occupying the house for a few days before claiming the lives of everyone in it. He oversees dinner and prayer, and requires the children to play and draw. Parenthood is a performance.  "
11/23/2005,Regulators investigate Samsung,
12/25/2005,Fiona Apple Gets It on the Second Try," 1. Fiona Apple: 'Extraordinary Machine' (Epic). Take 2 of this long-awaited, prematurely leaked album is the keeper. On the finished album, a little bit of Jon Brion's surreal cabaret orchestration brackets the newer stripped-down, focused versions of the songs. Ms. Apple continues her obsessive self-examination and convoluted thoughts of betrayal and regret, but now adds something: enough distance for some wry perspective.    2. M.I.A.: 'Arular' (Interscope). The means are modest: singsong choruses that could be playground chants, sparse tracks made with sounds from cheap synthesizers and drum machines. But the ambitions of M.I.A., a refugee from the civil war in Sri Lanka who went to art school in London, are huge and largely fulfilled on ''Arular,'' her debut album. The raps glance at violence, displacement, lust and determination in tracks that are irresistibly, incessantly danceable.    3. Shakira: 'Fijación Oral Vol. 1' (Epic). This is pop 2005: catchy songs about love found and (even better) lost that casually toss together reggaetón, bossa nova, Colombian cumbia, chanson and half a dozen varieties of rock, for starters. It all suits a voice that can be insouciant, sultry or desperately impassioned, and a songwriter whose globe-hopping comes naturally.    4. Sufjan Stevens: 'Illinois' (Asthmatic Kitty). Songs about significant events and characters in Illinois -- the second of the 50 states Mr. Stevens plans to write albums about -- are at once grandly orchestrated, homespun and emotionally resonant. With his large supporting cast, Mr. Stevens finds ways to take history personally.    5. The Frames: 'Burn the Maps' (Anti-). If Radiohead had a love life but stayed just as bleak, it would sound like the Frames on this album of heartsick, craggy, majestic rock songs that never trade drama for melodrama.    6. Bright Eyes: 'Digital Ash in a Digital Urn' (Saddle Creek). Conor Oberst, a k a Bright Eyes, released two albums simultaneously in 2005: the folk-rocking ''I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning'' and the far more electronic ''Digital Ash in a Digital Urn.'' Both are among the year's best albums. Yet where ''Wide Awake'' simply adds to Mr. Oberst's stockpile of brilliantly observed songs about personal matters like ambition and casual sex, ''Digital Ash'' uses its ricocheting, disembodied sounds to contemplate time, war, death and the meaning of life.    7. Bettye LaVette: 'I've Got My Own Hell to Raise' (Anti-). It seems all too conceptual to have a 59-year-old soul-music trouper sing a collection of songs by women. But Ms. LaVette's flinty voice and lean, bluesy, cannily arranged band tear into every song, turning old wounds into tokens of survival.    8. Stephen Malkmus: 'Face the Truth' (Matador). Three albums after the breakup of Pavement, his definitive 1990's indie-rock band, Stephen Malkmus remains waywardly alternative. His lyrics fling aperçus at life, art and commerce, while his tunes melt down the old verse-chorus-verse, deploy banjos and wobbly synthesizers, amble off on jam-band tangents, plunge into garage-rock or do the acoustic tango. He's as smart as he is mercurial.    9. Konono No. 1: 'Congotronics' (Crammed Discs). Take traditional, polyrhythmic thumb-piano trance music from Congo, plinking away in dizzying syncopated patterns. To crank it up for big outdoor parties, run it through buzzy pickups and amplifiers made from, among other things, scavenged car parts. The result is electric Minimalism that's exuberant and relentless, changing from percolating to hypnotic to a tingle that reaches deep into the nervous system.    10. Sleater-Kinney: 'The Woods' (Sub Pop). Distortion is everywhere on ''The Woods,'' Sleater-Kinney's seventh album, and it brings a nervy intensity to songs already worked up. With just two guitars, drums and Corin Tucker's banshee wail, Sleater-Kinney can sound as immense as a metal band and as bristling and unkempt as their indie-rock beginnings. Singing about love and war, truth and spectacle, the trio still plays as if everything were at stake.    Top Songs:     Bruce Springsteen: ''Devils & Dust''     Amerie: ''1 Thing''     Irma Thomas: ''Back Water Blues''     Miranda Lambert: ''Kerosene''     Kanye West: ''Gold Digger''"

12/13/2005,Elastic Voice That Fits a Personality in Evolution,"On Fiona Apple's new album, ''Extraordinary Machine,'' her ''Better Version of Me'' trumpets a personality upgrade. But every incarnation of this 28-year-old singer-songwriter has been fascinating, from the ferocious teenage provocateur of her 1996 debut, ''Tidal,'' to the fragile poet-warrior of the 1999 follow-up album, ''When the Pawn,'' to the current muscular songwriter whose work is so structurally sound it's hard to imagine that production indecision held up its release for years.     At her packed show at the Nokia Theater in Midtown on Sunday, when Ms. Apple admitted ambivalence about being onstage, a devotee admonished, ''It's where you belong, honey!'' But in the years after the disappointing sales of ''When the Pawn,'' Ms. Apple has confessed to being happier sitting in her yard carving pine cones with razor blades. Resistance to fame, evidenced most famously by her petulant outburst at 1997's MTV Awards, has always endeared her to fans. But they also want her to make music, lobbying for the release of the delayed new record after a scrapped version, made with Jon Brion as producer, leaked online last year.  "

In terms of subject matter, Rocketboom is actually quite a standard -- one might even say traditional -- Web log: Ms. Congdon comments on intriguing items she, and the site's producer, Andrew Baron, have found on the Web, and includes links to them which appear just below clear, smooth-playing video. The items tend to be developments in Internet culture (robots and flash mobs, say, or flash mobs of robots) with a sprinkling of left-leaning political commentary (Ms. Congdon announced the posting of Representative Tom DeLay's mug shot while wearing a party hat and blowing a noisemaker) and samples of Web video from around the world.

How you feel about this depends very much on whether you're a Windows or an Apple person.      From one angle, Boot Camp looks like a sensible effort to expand Apple's slice of the personal computer market. So far, switching from a Windows desktop to a much sleeker iMac has meant abandoning Windows for Apple's Mac OS X operating system. That means giving up some highly specialized applications for which there is no Apple equivalent.

5/9/2006,Apple Versus Apple,"It was a good year to be a Beatles fan in 1965, the year of ''Help!'' and ''Rubber Soul.'' It was also the year the group's publishing company, Northern Songs, went public. That early step in the commodification of the Beatles culminated in, among other things, the recent $200 million refinancing of Michael Jackson, the current co-owner of the Northern Songs catalog. Yesterday, another curious episode in the band's business history came to an apparent close in Britain, where a judge ruled against Apple Corps, the Beatles' management company, in its 2003 suit against Apple Computer.      The suit's origin was in Apple Computer's creation of iTunes, which Apple Corps interpreted as a violation of a 1991 agreement that would, in its opinion, have prevented the other Apple from distributing music. (The agreement would also have prevented Apple Corps from making computers.) Apple Corps, which was founded in 1968 to gather the Beatles' business interests under one roof, seems to have been born for trouble. Its logo, designed by Gene Mahon, is as clean and crisp as it ever was, but to many observers the company appears to have done a better of spawning lawsuits over the years than of fostering the Beatles' interests.
